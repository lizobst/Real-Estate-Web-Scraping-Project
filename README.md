# Real-Estate-Web-Scraping-Project
In this project I collected real estate data for houses located in 10 Texas cities. I chose these cities based on cities I would like to live in the future. This data could be helpful in allowing me to evaluate which city would be best for me based on housing cost.

This project allowed me to practice end to end data analysis. Data collection was performed through web scraping in Python and analyses performed using Python and PostgreSQL.

### How It's Made
Tech used: Python and PosgreSQL

Libraries used: BeautifulSoup, Selenium, Pandas, Matplotlib, SQLAlchemy, Seaborn

### Lessons Learned
Web scraping proved particularly difficult on a dynamic website. Overcoming that hurdle was challenging but exciting. I enjoyed the process of collecting my own data through web scraping and would like to apply this process to something more exciting in the future. The analyses surprised me as I suspected Austin would be one of the most expensive, but I didn't expect just how much more expensive it would be.
